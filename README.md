# The Wizard's Kit

*It's cold, its windy, The castle just **kicked** you out.* 

*Apparently you're illuminating a purple aura.* 

*You hear a voice calling you. It's raspy, like that old wizard guy who adored Harry Potter.*

*You then see it. A book. **YOUR** book. It has a silver pentacle. It has in thick letterings, the words - THE SOMMONER'S OATH - You slowly pick it up.* 

*It feels rather heavy. You feel some sort of energy, mana, as they called it.* 

*You take a peek inside. Its contents shock you.* 

*Besides it lay a golden shrine.* 

*Almost looks like a futuristic sand timer.* 

*It somehow.. floats? It looks really cool, its **MAGIC**...*
